# Big game logic and outer game model

## Add logic to each game of a creator and player 2 where:
  ### Each is a string, updated according to req.user.email and second user email to creator and player2 respectively. These can be used for later checks on things and the ultimate array answer logic

  ## Creator and Player finished - Boolean default false - updated when corresponding user has finished all ten restaurant voting

## Creator and Player selection array
  If we can ensure the restaurants correspond to their ids we can push a true / false boolean to an array for each player. the check for a match occurs when both players have finished and the arrays are populated. 
  ON A LIKE - push true
  ON A DISLIKE - push false
  Then a check can be ran comparing each of the indexes for if both match

  a backup array can push the restaurant name to ensure this is working properly and we dont have disorganized data connections


# in each rest sub model 

## match game meta object
  ### liked array push booleans -Non user specific, but can help with results logic and completion logic
    true if LIKE
    false if DISLIKE
    
  ### creatorFinished Boolean
  ### player finished Boolean

  ## restGameComplete Boolean - determines if restaurant has been voted by both users, if they have true, default false
